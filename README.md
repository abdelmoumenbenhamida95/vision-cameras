I replaced the Cognex camera with a better Keyence camera that includes a Keyence controller and adjusted the program and modified the tools. After my improvements, the new camera was capable of capturing higher depth, volume, and brace consistency. This upgrade was made to achieve more accurate data during the inspection process.

I programmed and installed enhancements to improve the camera's performance. Before the camera was not effectively detecting parts and it was not properly focused. I modified the program and tools to achieve the desired results. Before the updates, the camera was only checking if the brace was present, but it was not accurate.
